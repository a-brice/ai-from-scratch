# ai-from-scratch
machine learning techniques and algorithms built from scratch such as : 
- K Nearest Neighbors with cross validation 
- comparison between brute force and gradient descent applied on basic regression problem
- Artificial Intelligence for TicTacToe game based on MiniMax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning 

and an extra, the graph coloring problem to compare the drastic difference between polynomial algorithms O(nÂ²) and exponential algorithms O(e^n)
